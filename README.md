Title: Origin and evolution of molecular gas in the ram pressure stripped galactic tail of NGC4388

The center of the galaxy was placed offcenter ("lower-right") as to
widen the search in the North-East quadrant.

The nearly edge-on disk is clearly detected, and clearly rotating. 
West side is receding, PA ~ 95.  Seems less CO in the center.

Seems no other CO in the cube, even after smoothing.

VLA HI maps show some off-axis HI, but about 250" SE of the center..
Hope this is not what was intended to search for counterpart CO. It
would also be in the far upper left corner of the OTF field.

Arecebo shows HI emission from ~ 2300 - 2700 km/s, average ~ 15 mJy
